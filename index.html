            <h1>Biograpghy</h1>
            <p>Maharana Pratap was born to Udai Singh II of Mewar and Jaiwanta Bai in 1540, the year in which Udai Singh ascended to th
            e throne after defeating Vanvir Singh. His younger brothers were Shakti Singh, Vikram Singh and Jagmal Singh. 
            Pratap also had two stepsisters: Chand Kanwar and Man Kanwar. His chief consort was Maharani Ajabde Bai Punwar of Bijolia.
            Their eldest son was Amar Singh I. He belonged to the Royal family of Mewar. After the death of Udai Singh in 1572, 
            Rani Dheer Bai Bhatiyani wanted her son Jagmal to succeed him but senior courtiers preferred Pratap, as the eldest son, to
             be their king. The desire of the nobles prevailed and Pratap ascended the throne as Maharana Pratap, the 54th ruler of Mewar in
              the line of the Sisodia Rajputs. He was crowned in Gogunda on the auspicious day of Holi. Jagmal swore revenge and left for
               Ajmer, to join the armies of Akbar, and obtained the town of Jahazpur as a Jagir as a gift in return for his help.</p>
            <p>In stark contrast to other Rajput rulers who accommodated and formed alliances with the various Muslim dynasties in the
                 subcontinent, by the time Pratap ascended to the throne, Mewar was going through a long standing conflict with the Mughals 
                 which started with the defeat of his grandfather Rana Sanga in the Battle of Khanwa in 1527 and continued with the defeat
                  of his father Udai Singh II in Siege of Chittorgarh in 1568. Pratap Singh, gained distinction for his refusal to form any 
                  political alliance with the Mughal Empire and his resistance to Muslim domination. 
                The conflicts between Pratap Singh and Akbar led to the Battle of Haldighati.</p>

            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>He was succeeded by his eldest son Amar Singh I. Notable historian such as Satish Chandra have said that Maharana Pratap’s struggle against the Mughal
                 empire almost alone and unaided by other Rajput states signify the best of Rajput valour and the spirit of self-sacrifice. Furthermore, his method 
                 of guerrilla warfare would be further improved and emulated by none other than Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj (Birth of Shivaji Maharaji February 19, 
                 1630) himself.He is revered as a symbol of courage, patriotism, and sacrifice.</p>
            <p>Maharana Pratap is a prominent figure in both folk and contemporary Rajasthani culture and is viewed as a celebrated warrior in that state, as well as 
                in India as a whole.

                <br><pre>Historian Satish Chandra notes –
                
                "Rana Pratap's defiance of the mighty Mughal empire, almost alone and unaided by the other Rajput states, 
                constitute a glorious saga of Rajput valour and the spirit of self sacrifice for cherished principles. 
                Rana Pratap's methods of guerrilla warfare was later elaborated further by Malik Ambar, the Deccani general, 
                and by Emperor Shivaji".</pre><br>
                
                Bandyopadhyay also seconds Satish Chandra's view with the observation that<br>
                
                Pratap's successful defiance of Mughals using guerrilla strategy also proved inspirational to figures ranging from Emperor Shivaji to anti-British 
                revolutionaries in Bengal.<br>
                
                In 2007, a statue of Maharana Pratap was unveiled by former President Pratibha Patil in the Parliament of India.</p>

            <h2>Tribute to Maharana Pratap</h2>
            <p>Maharana Pratap's dedication to his kingdom and his people remains an example of selflessness and bravery.</p>
            <h3>Battle of Haldighati</h3>
                <p>The Siege of Chittorgarh in 1567-1568 had led to the loss of the fertile eastern belt of Mewar to the Mughals. However, the rest of the wooded and 
                hilly kingdom in the Aravalli range was still under the control of Maharana Pratap. Mughal Emperor Akbar was intent on securing a stable route to 
                Gujarat through Mewar; when Pratap Singh was crowned king (Maharana) in 1572, Akbar sent a number of envoys, including one by Raja Man Singh I of Amer,
                 entreating him to become a vassal like many other rulers in Rajputana. When Pratap refused to personally submit to Akbar and several attempts to 
                 diplomatically settle the issue failed, war became inevitable.             
                The forces of Pratap Singh and Mughal and Rajput general Man Singh met on 18 June 1576 beyond a narrow mountain pass at Haldighati near Gogunda, modern
                 day Rajsamand in Rajasthan. This came to be known as the Battle of Haldighati. Pratap Singh fielded a force of around 3000 cavalry and 400 Bhil
                  archers. Man Singh commanded an army numbering around 10,000 men. After a fierce battle lasting more than three hours, Pratap found himself wounded 
                  and the day lost. He managed to retreat to the hills and lived to fight another day. The Mughals were victorious and inflicted significant 
                  casualties among the forces of Mewar but failed to capture Maharana Pratap.
                
                Haldighati was a futile victory for the Mughals, as they were unable to kill or capture Pratap, or any of his close family members in Udaipur.
                While the sources also claim that Pratap was able to make a successful escape, Man Singh managed to conquer Gogunda within a week after Haldighati 
                then ended his campaign. Subsequently, Akbar himself led a sustained campaign against the Rana in September 1576, and soon, Gogunda, Udaipur, and
                Kumbhalgarh were all under Mughal control.</p>
                
                <h3>Reconquest of Mewar</h3>
                
                <p> Maharana Pratap Memorial in Dewair for the battle of 1582.
                Mughal pressure on Mewar relaxed after 1579 following rebellions in Bengal and Bihar and Mirza Hakim's incursion into the Punjab. After this Akbar sent 
                Jagannath Kachhwaha to invade Mewar in 1584. This time too Mewar army defeated Mughals and forced them to retreat. In 1585, Akbar moved to Lahore and 
                remained there for the next twelve years watching the situation in the north-west. No major Mughal expedition was sent to Mewar during this period. 
                Taking advantage of the situation, Pratap recovered most of Mewar (except its former capital), Chittorgarh and Mandalgarh regions by defeating Mughal 
                forces there. During this period, he also built a new capital, Chavand, near modern Dungarpur.</p>
